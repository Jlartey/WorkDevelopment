undingPips 2-Step Evaluation Terms of Use 1. It's All About Discipline And
Consistency. No need to rush, you don't build a life in a day. There is plenty
of time to pass the evaluation successfully, being dynamic is crucial. 2.
Trading Behaviour and Rules We offer a FundingPips Evaluation course which is
based on two phases, student and practitioner, which you need to pass to become
a Master trader aka funded trader. It's crucial that you have a dynamic trading
system & risk management profile to pass the evaluation course. After you reach
your profit target in Phase 2, your entire evaluation period will be manually
reviewed by our Risk Team. This review process will be completed within two
working days. In the event of a breach of any of the rules referred to in this
section, all positions on the platform shall be closed immediately, the
Customer’s Account will be closed and the right to any reward will be revoked.
2.1. The Student Phase (Phase I) The student phase is to test your trading
skills while defining yourself as a trader. During the student phase, you must
achieve a profit target of 8% or 10% without breaching any other rule and have 3
minimum trading days. 2.2. The Practitioner Phase (Phase II) The practitioner
phase is just to confirm the results and outcomes of the student phase. During
the practitioner phase, you must achieve a profit target of 5% without breaching
any other rule and have 3 minimum trading days. 2.3. 5% Maximum Daily Loss Limit
The Maximum Daily Loss is the amount the trader is allowed to lose every day.
For the purpose of this rule, the higher value between equity and balance will
be used. This rule is set to 5% of the starting equity or balance every day. The
rule states that the equity of the day, which is the result of the currently
floating PnL (Profit and Loss) in sum with all closed positions of that day,
must not hit the Maximum Daily Loss Limit. The daily maximum loss resets at
00:00 CE(S)T/server every day. 2.4. 10% Maximum Loss Limit The Maximum Loss
Limit is the amount the equity or balance can't go below. This rule is set to
10% of the initial account size. For example, if the trader has a $100,000
account and the Maximum Loss Limit is 10%, the equity or balance can't go below
$90,000 at any moment. FundingPips Evaluation – Terms of Use 2.5. On this
Evaluation you are allowed to hold trades during news and over the weekend
2.5.1. During the Evaluation (Student and Practitioner) You are allowed to hold
trades over the weekend and trade during the news in the evaluation stage.
2.5.2. During the Funded (Master only) You are allowed to hold trades during
news and over the weekend. Profit from trades that are opened or closed 5
minutes prior to and after high impact news events and/or speeches on the
affected currency will not be counted on the Master account UNLESS the trade was
executed 5 hours prior to the news event*. This restriction applies to all forms
of trade execution, such as manual, pending, stop loss and take profit orders.
During news speeches, the prohibited window will extend 5 minutes prior to the
speech until 5 minutes after the speech has been finished. News event trading
will result in the deduction of any profits made from trades executed within the
restricted 10-minute window. Our system will automatically close the affected
trades that are opened within the prohibited time window. We use Forex Factory
as our news calendar source. In the event any deductions result in the breach of
the daily loss limit or maximum loss limit, the trader is responsible for the
violation. Read more about news trading in our FAQ "Can I hold trades during
news and over the weekend?". *Note: To help swing traders while preventing news
gamblers, trades that are opened 5 hours prior to a high impact news event are
excluded and allowed to close within the prohibited time window. The profits of
these trades will be counted. We do not support purposely trading news and it
will lead to a termination. 2.6. Trading Strategy Trade the way you want. Use an
"EA", hold during news, hold trades over the weekend and trade lot sizes as big
as the leverage allows for as long as it is not: Gap trading, high frequency
trading, server spamming, latency arbitrage, toxic trading flow, hedging, long
short arbitrage, reverse arbitrage, tick scalping, server execution, opposite
account trading, which are all prohibited. Also, copy trading with others or
account management by a third-party vendor is prohibited. Such activities with
Funding Pips will result in account termination. Keep in mind that using a
third-party Expert Advisor is allowed as long as it is a trade or risk manager.
Using any other third-party Expert Advisor is not allowed. This will lead to a
denial of the evaluation or reward and closure of the account. FundingPips
Evaluation – Terms of Use 3. Toxic Trading Flow (Responsible Trading Rules)
Toxic Trading is defined as reckless risk-taking, impulsive behavior, and a
disregard for fundamental principles. The threat of toxic trading jeopardizes
not only individual trader accounts but also the stability of proprietary
trading firms. We will shed light on toxic trading, defining its various
manifestations and underscoring the imperative for vigilance and responsibility
in the pursuit of profitable trading strategies. Toxic trading encompasses a
variety of behaviors and practices, with some common characteristics including
the following: Excessive Risk-Taking (Over-Leveraging) Participating in trades
with disproportionately high levels of risk in relation to the trader's capital
or risk tolerance. This often involves utilizing excessive leverage causing
overexposure or full margin, which can magnify both gains and losses.
Additionally, for the 2-Step Master accounts only, executing excessive amounts
of lots relative to the account size exceeding the Maximum Lot Exposure Limit.
See "What is the Maximum Lot Exposure Limit? (2-Step Master account only)" to
read more. Maximum Lot Exposure Limit per account size (2-Step Master accounts
only) $25,000 is max 10 lots $50,000 is max 20 lots $100,000 is max 40 lots
There is no limit applied on the 5,000 and 10,000 2-Step Master accounts. If the
trades are closed, you are allowed to open new trades on the same day. The
Maximum Lot Exposure Limit is only for the open trades, it is NOT a daily limit.
If you exceed this limit, all the profits from trades that were opened and were
ABOVE the limit will be deducted from the account. In the event any deductions
result in the breach of the daily loss limit or maximum loss limit, the trader
is responsible for the violation. The first time we detect that the lot exposure
limit was exceeded will result in a warning. The second time will result in a
closure of the account, profit deduction and 30% performance commission, plus
all the profits from trades that were opened and were ABOVE the limit will be
deducted from the account. Gambling Behavior Trading is driven by emotions
rather than rational analysis, similar to gambling. Traders may pursue losses,
make impulsive trades, or display addictive tendencies, leading to negative
trading outcomes. Your biggest loss should not exceed 3% of the account size on
the Master accounts only. Splitting up a trade into multiple positions will be
counted as one single trade on any of our accounts. FundingPips Evaluation –
Terms of Use Overtrading Continuously entering and exiting trades without a
clear strategy or rationale, resulting in diminished profitability and emotional
exhaustion. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) & Tick Scalping Engaging in excessive
and rapid trading activities indicative of higher volatility, which may result
in significant losses. Arbitrage All forms of arbitrage are considered toxic due
to the lack of a clear underlying idea, strategy, or rationale. Below are two
common arbitrage strategies: ● Hedge Arbitrage: Simultaneously entering opposing
positions with different firms. ● Latency Arbitrage: Exploiting disparities in
trade execution times across various trading platforms or venues. Traders using
this strategy seek to profit from minor price differences resulting from delays
in order processing or data feed. Poor Money Management Traders who frequently
encounter margin calls due to inadequate funds or risky positions may indicate a
lack of risk management, posing a threat to their accounts and potentially the
firm’s stability. Behavioral Patterns Inconsistent behaviors, such as trading
during non-liquid market hours to exploit liquidity shortages, consistently
disregarding risk management principles, or making emotional decisions. Reverse
Trading Signs and behavior, which includes risking the full daily loss on one
trade, which often indicates reverse trading between different firms. Traders
suspected of engaging in such behaviors may be subjected to various restrictions
including but not limited to reducing leverage, limiting the number of trades
per day, lot size limit per day, lower daily/max loss limiting the risk per
trade, imposing a maximum 1% risk limit rule or even being banned from the firm.
