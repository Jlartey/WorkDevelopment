I have requested that no blood or blood products be administered to me/the patient named above and have signed the refusal to consent <br>
 to transfusion of blood and blood products on the other side of this form. However, I have received an explanation about re-infusion of <br> 
 my/the patient’s own blood that is salvage during and immediately after my operation/procedure. I understand that if the <br>
 operation/procedure may involve increased blood loss, the surgeon may order the use of a re-infusion or cell saver device, and I consent <br>
 to the use of such device on me/the patient named above for re-infusion of my/the patient’s own blood. <br>
I give this consent with full knowledge and understanding that medicine is not an exact science, that there is the possibility that the <br> transfusion and/or re-infusion may not have the benefits or results intended, and that there are always risks and dangers to life and health <br>
associated generally with surgery, use of blood and/or blood products, medical procedures, and treatments which can cause adverse <br>
 consequences not ordinarily in advance. <br>
I confirm that I have read and fully understand this document, that I have been given the opportunity to ask questions about transfusion<br>
 and re-infusion of blood and/or blood products and gave had my questions answered satisfactorily, and that I am eligible to give this <br>
 consent.
